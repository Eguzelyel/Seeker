__Purpose:__

To empower people by showing different life styles versus aging. We encourage people to change their lifestyles,
and provide a solid proof that it actually make a difference for their lives.


__Method:__

We compare patient surveys for their habits versus their telomere lenght of their leukocytes. 
We have three approaches to the problem. 
1- Mathematical Approach:
2- Statistical Approach:
3- Machine Learning: We built multiple ML models, and decided to use a fully connected neural network in order to make the predictions.

This study may include sensitive information. Use it in your own will.


__Main Files:__

Predictions.ipynb to run the code and visualization.


__Data usage:__

We gathered the data from online sources, primarily from Prof. Blackburn's lab and National Center for Health Statistics.
The data is publicly available; however, we preprocessed it with our own parameters. Do not distribute without authorization.
